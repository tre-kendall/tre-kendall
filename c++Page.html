      This project was from the first coding class I took on a coding language. I created a project that would tell you your zodiac sign that corresponds with your birthday. Learning C++ my junior year of high school taught me the fundamentals and motivated me to learn other languages. This project specifically was a group project, so it has all of our incorporated styles into one code. I found it cool how people with different styles can work together and make something better.
